Sync tool for [MTGAHelper](https://mtgahelper.com).

## What does it do?

It updates your mtgahelper account data with card ratings from 17lands. This way you have the latest information during drafts.

## What does it show?

Currently it shows overall Win% and "Improvement when drawn"-Points.

## How do I do it?

- Download latest [release](https://github.com/LazarQt/LimitedPower.DraftHelperSync/releases)
- Unzip it and edit LimitedPower.DraftHelperSync.dll.config to include your cookie
- Cookie can be found by going to https://mtgahelper.com/my/draftRatings, logging in, pressing F12 to open developer tools, editing ANY card, then looking at request headers from the latest request

## Configuration Settings

In addition to the cookie there are other settings required to make the synchronization process work.

  - PastDays: Ratings will be downloaded from this very day to a number of days in the past
  - StartDate: Ratings will be downloaded from a particular day onwards
- TimeSpanValue:
  - For "PastDays", you will have to enter the number of days
  - For "StartDate" enter a specific date (Format: "2022-01-30" - year-month-day)
- DraftType: PremierDraft, TradDraft, Sealed, QuickDraft (self explanatory)
- RatingType:
  - AvgPick: Pick order determined by AvgPick data set from 17Lands
